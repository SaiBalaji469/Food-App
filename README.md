## Overview

This project is a beginner-friendly **React.js** website styled with **Tailwind CSS**, designed with a **mobile-first responsive approach**. The website uses **Flexbox** and **Grid layouts** to ensure the layout is flexible and responsive across different screen sizes.

Throughout this tutorial, we will build a website by pulling data and images from a `data.js` file, simulating an API response. Weâ€™ll also filter the data and images dynamically using the JavaScript `filter` array method, providing an interactive experience for users.

## Features

### 1. **Responsive Design**
   - The website is built with **Tailwind CSS**, following a **mobile-first responsive design** approach. The layout adapts seamlessly to various screen sizes using **Flexbox** and **Grid** layouts.
   - The website is fully optimized for mobile devices, ensuring users get the best experience on both small and large screens.

### 2. **React Components**
   - The project is structured using **React** components to make the code modular and maintainable.
   - Each section of the page (e.g., header, content, footer) is managed in individual components, improving the scalability of the project.

### 3. **Data from `data.js`**
   - The data for the website, including images and text, is stored in a `data.js` file. This simulates an API response and serves as the source of dynamic content on the page.
   - The data is used to populate sections like images, titles, and descriptions.

### 4. **Dynamic Data Filtering**
   - The project demonstrates how to filter through data dynamically using the JavaScript `filter` array method.
   - Users can filter data and images based on specific criteria (such as categories or tags), providing an interactive user experience.

### 5. **Tailwind CSS Styling**
   - **Tailwind CSS** is used for styling the project, utilizing utility classes for fast and efficient design customization.
   - The use of **Tailwind's Flexbox** and **Grid** utilities allows for a flexible layout that is both clean and responsive.

### 6. **Interactivity**
   - As part of the tutorial, the project includes interactive elements that change based on user actions, such as filtering content and dynamically updating the page.

## Technologies Used

- **React.js**: JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- **Tailwind CSS**: A utility-first CSS framework for styling the project.
- **JavaScript**: Used for handling dynamic behavior, including data filtering.
